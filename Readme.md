# A live Notebook ipywidgets Gallery

[the idea and implementation comes from Daniel Rodriguez](https://github.com/danielfrg/jupyter-flex.git). Since a long time I was looking for such a simple Jupyter Lab Widget live gallery. It is there thanks to Daniel!

I have extracted this notebook here for further reference!
